# intrusion-detection

This project involves the group workings for the final project for the course Intrusion Detection Laboratory. The aim of the project is to develop a fully-fledged intrusion detection system (IDS) for a given dataset, either signature or anomaly-based. Our group was assigned to create an anomaly-based IDS for host logs from IMAP servers, gathered from the TU/eâ€™s network.

For a detailed report, take a look at the PDF.

To see the detection algorithm, take a look at the Jupyter Notebook detection.ipynb.

The Notebook AnomalyLab_IMAP_Group7.ipynb contains the laboratory we proposed in class.
